# Bungee-Drop-
This is a python script that can be used for the Science Olympiad Bungee Drop event. The script models a multvaraible quadratic regression function that is in terms of the mass(g) and drop height (cm). The first thing that must be done is to get some data and pass it in as a .csv file. You must have at least 3 columuns: one for the mass being dropped, one for the drop height: and one for the cord length needed for the specific run. Note that to get data points to model you will have to utilize trial and error and the cord length will be based on how close to the ground, you want the bottle. Once you have enough data points pass in a csv file of your data and the script will generate a function that will give you the necessary cord length for a given drop height and mass. It will also give you an R^2 value as well as graph. Lastly there is also a testing script that can be utilized to calculate cord lengths, and do simulations to see how well your function is performing. Start with all boundary conditions and then aim to get at least 20 points before using this function.
